Census of the Wild Code School!

You will create a class that represents your classmates as best as you can!

Create a Wilder class.

Adds the attributes String firstname and boolean present.

Create a constructor to initialise firstname and present.

Add getters and setters for all attributes, according to the conventions.

Add a whoAmI() method that returns the text "My name is firstname and I am present" or "My name is firstname and I am not present", depending on the state of the attributes firstname and present.

Create a Classroom class with a main() method.

Add references to several instances of the Wilder class inside the main() method of Classroom.

For each of the references, display the result of the whoAmI() method in the terminal.

Compile and test Classroom: once everything is working perfectly, create a git repository and send it all to GitHub.

Share the link to the GitHub repository as your solution.
